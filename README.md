# NFT-Hackathlon

In this project we analyse the Veefriends NFT dataset, But first what is NFT and what is Veefriends!!!!?. Before we dive in the analyses, I'll give some introduction for NFTs and the history of the Veefriends project in the next few lines

## NFT (Non-Fungible Token):
1. A non-fungible (meaning unique, non-replaceable) token (NFT) is a unique digital code that represents some kind of digital item. It could be digital art or music, for example. 
2. An NFT is secured and stored on a public blockchain. 
3. One token is not interchangeable for another, and a token cannot be further divided.
4. There are many different types of non-fungible tokens, and they can be created on well-known blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

### If you are interested in getting started with NFT, then you will need two things:
1. A MetaMask wallet, which you can download at https://metamask.io
2. Ether, the “currency” you’ll need to make transactions. You can obtain Ether from popular crypto-exchanges such as Coinbase, accessed at https://www.coinbase.com
